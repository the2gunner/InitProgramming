history of programming 

The story of programming began when the need for computation arose and led to the creation of programms. during WW2 in order to develop the first atomic bomb scientists had to calculte large numbers accurately. But that rquired time and man power that the scientists of the time didnt have, and so the a program was developed that allowed the mathematically gifted wives and sons of scientists who lived in a confined enviroment to contribute by running calculating machines in order to save time. Those individuals were named computers and they were given three machines that multiplied,added and subtracted large numbers and due to the contribution of these "computers" america was able to win the second world war .
